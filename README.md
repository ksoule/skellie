# Skeleton with Notes

## Working on any vertical slice (step by step)
 (this assumes you've done your schema, migration, and base models without associations first)

- determine how you are going to get to the functionality you are building (click a link, type in the url, submit a form)
- If click a link / submit a form, go the the erb (or create the erb) and add the link or the form html changes to it!
- Now write the route in your controller file for the link or form action from the last step
- In your controller route, decide what data you need from your model
- decide where you will go next (erb / redirect)
- In your models, you may need to add associations / validations / methods to support your work
